The survey was open to anyone and people were motivated to take it to get personalized results. At the end of the test they also were given the option to complete a short research survey. This datatset comes from those who agreed to complete the research survey and answered yes to the question "Have you given accurate answers and may they be used for research?" at the end.

1 = Did not apply to me at all 
2 = Applied to me to some degree, or some of the time
3 = Applied to me to a considerable degree, or a good part of the time
4 = Applied to me very much, or most of the time

This response is stored in variable A (e.g. Q1A). Also recorded was the time taken in milliseconds to answer that question (E) and that question's position in the survey (I). ### REMOVED THE "E's" AND "I's" RETAINING JUST SURVEY RESPONSE DATA ###

These other durations were also recorded (measured on the server's side):

introelapse		The time spent on the introduction/landing page (in seconds)
testelapse		The time spent on all the DASS questions (should be equivalent to the time elapsed on all the indiviudal questions combined)
surveyelapse	The time spent answering the rest of the demographic and survey questions

On the next page was a generic demographics survey with many different questions.

The Ten Item Personality Inventory was administered (see Gosling, S. D., Rentfrow, P. J., & Swann, W. B., Jr. (2003). A Very Brief Measure of the Big Five Personality Domains. Journal of Research in Personality, 37, 504-528.):

TIPI1	Extraverted, enthusiastic.
TIPI2	Critical, quarrelsome.
TIPI3	Dependable, self-disciplined.
TIPI4	Anxious, easily upset.
TIPI5	Open to new experiences, complex.
TIPI6	Reserved, quiet.
TIPI7	Sympathetic, warm.
TIPI8	Disorganized, careless.
TIPI9	Calm, emotionally stable.
TIPI10	Conventional, uncreative.

The TIPI items were rated "I see myself as:" _____ such that

1 = Disagree strongly
2 = Disagree moderately
3 = Disagree a little
4 = Neither agree nor disagree
5 = Agree a little
6 = Agree moderately
7 = Agree strongly


#### BELOW REMOVED FROM DATA ###
The following items were presented as a check-list and subjects were instructed "In the grid below, check all the words whose definitions you are sure you know":

VCL1	boat
VCL2	incoherent
VCL3	pallid
VCL4	robot
VCL5	audible
VCL6	cuivocal
VCL7	paucity
VCL8	epistemology
VCL9	florted
VCL10	decide
VCL11	pastiche
VCL12	verdid
VCL13	abysmal
VCL14	lucid
VCL15	betray
VCL16	funny

A value of 1 is checked, 0 means unchecked. The words at VCL6, VCL9, and VCL12 are not real words and can be used as a validity check.

A bunch more questions were then asked:

The following values were derived from technical information:

country				ISO country code of where the user connected from
screensize			1=device with small screen (phone, etc), 2=device with big screen (laptop, desktop, etc)
uniquenetworklocation		1=only one survey from user's specific network in dataset, 2=multiple surveys submitted from the network of this user  (2 does not necessarily imply duplicate records for an individual, as it could be different students at a single school or different memebers of the same household; and even if 1 there still could be duplicate records from a single individual e.g. if they took it once on their wifi and once on their phone)
source			how the user found the test, 1=from the front page of the site hosting the survey, 2=from google, 0=other or unknown
